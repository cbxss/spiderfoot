> **Revival Fork** of [smicallef/spiderfoot](https://github.com/smicallef/spiderfoot) — modernized for Python 3.10+, cleaned up dead modules, and actively maintained. See [CHANGES.md](CHANGES.md) for the full list of improvements.

**SpiderFoot** is an open source intelligence (OSINT) automation tool. It integrates with just about every data source available and utilises a range of methods for data analysis, making that data easy to navigate.

SpiderFoot has an embedded web-server for providing a clean and intuitive web-based interface but can also be used completely via the command-line.  It's written in **Python 3** and **MIT-licensed**.

### USES

SpiderFoot can be used offensively (e.g. in a red team exercise or penetration test) for reconnaissance of your target or defensively to gather information about what you or your organisation might have exposed over the Internet.

You can target the following entities in a SpiderFoot scan:

 - IP address
 - Domain/sub-domain name
 - Hostname
 - Network subnet (CIDR)
 - ASN
 - E-mail address
 - Phone number
 - Username
 - Person's name
 - Bitcoin address

SpiderFoot's 215+ modules feed each other in a publisher/subscriber model to ensure maximum data extraction to do things like:

- [Host/sub-domain/TLD enumeration/extraction](https://asciinema.org/a/295912)
- [Email address, phone number and human name extraction](https://asciinema.org/a/295947)
- [Bitcoin and Ethereum address extraction](https://asciinema.org/a/295957)
- [Check for susceptibility to sub-domain hijacking](https://asciinema.org/a/344377)
- DNS zone transfers
- [Threat intelligence and Blacklist queries](https://asciinema.org/a/295949)
- API integration with [SHODAN](https://asciinema.org/a/127601), [HaveIBeenPwned](https://asciinema.org/a/128731), [GreyNoise](https://asciinema.org/a/295943), AlienVault, SecurityTrails, etc.
- [Social media account enumeration](https://asciinema.org/a/295923)
- [S3/Azure/Digitalocean bucket enumeration/scraping](https://asciinema.org/a/295941)
- IP geo-location
- Web scraping, web content analysis
- [Image, document and binary file meta data analysis](https://asciinema.org/a/296274)
- Dark web searches
- [Port scanning and banner grabbing](https://asciinema.org/a/295939)
- [Data breach searches](https://asciinema.org/a/296145)
- So much more...

### INSTALLING & RUNNING

SpiderFoot requires Python 3.10+ and uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management.

#### Quick start:

```
git clone https://github.com/cbxss/spiderfoot.git
cd spiderfoot
uv venv && uv sync
uv run python sf.py -l 127.0.0.1:5001
```

#### Using pip (alternative):

```
git clone https://github.com/cbxss/spiderfoot.git
cd spiderfoot
pip3 install .
python3 ./sf.py -l 127.0.0.1:5001
```

#### Docker:

```
docker build -t spiderfoot .
docker run -p 5001:5001 -v sf_data:/var/lib/spiderfoot spiderfoot
```

Check out the [documentation](https://www.spiderfoot.net/documentation) and our [asciinema videos](https://asciinema.org/~spiderfoot) for more tutorials.

### COMMUNITY

Whether you're a contributor, user or just curious about SpiderFoot and OSINT in general, we'd love to have you join our community! SpiderFoot has a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/vyvztrG) for seeking help from the community, requesting features or just general OSINT chit-chat.

### WRITING CORRELATION RULES

We have a comprehensive write-up and reference of the correlation rule-set introduced in SpiderFoot 4.0 [here](/correlations/README.md).

Also take a look at the [template.yaml](/correlations/template.yaml) file for a walk through. The existing [37 rules](/correlations) are also quite readable and good as starting points for additional rules.
